Already a new year and it has been way too long since I last wrote, almost 2 months.  I have been driving for almost 7 months.  I ended up passing per-cal but just barely.  Christmas was great and I think I am going to keep trying on that blog.  On top of that, I am continuing work on my website I started and am glad that it is coming along.  The official opening is planned for next Monday which gives me a week for the final changes.  I just started a new site with Amy, a High School RPG, that will keep me on my toes and constantly busy.
