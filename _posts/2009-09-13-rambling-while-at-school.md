It's been a while since I have written.  A little over 3 months.  Already been driving for two months, now almost 3 months.  Haven't wrecked or gotten a ticket, a miracle I know.  This will be the start of the third week of school and I am failing pre-cal.  Everything else is good.  Tomorrow is FCA and tech crew tryouts.  I am hoping to make a spot on the tech crew.  FCA is just more of a hope, I enjoy the group.  Tomorrow is also picture day, got to look my best.
