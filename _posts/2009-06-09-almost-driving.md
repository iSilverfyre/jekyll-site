I am barely 16 but yet it seems that I am 15.  I am still 10 days away from getting my license.  Can you believe it?  Soon I will be out job searching and free like a bird.  Mom is paying for the insurance so I can drive.  I can't wait, it makes me so excited.  I am still trying in Chemistry, but it still is somewhat hard.  The last day of school is Tuesday, and Ashley and I are going to see Knowing and Twilight.  I want to help with VBS decorations but I am not sure how often I will be able to help with all the doctor appointments.
