Well, the official opening didn't occur for the website. Macster(Dan) and I are still working.  Hopefully, it will all be done by the end of this month.  I currently am running 4 sites and am still considering continuing my blog.  With Technology Discussion doing alright I am attempting to win a domain for the site Amy and I have so that it seems somewhat more official.  I wish I had known I could use a personal domain on proboards before starting fourmation.
